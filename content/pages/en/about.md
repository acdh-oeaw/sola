## Sunday Observance in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages

Research Project financed by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), Project P
31428-G32.

Realized also in collaboration with the Austrian Center for Digital Humanities
(ACDH) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW).

January 2019 – December 2022.

### Hypotheses

The Christian Sunday as a day of rest is one central identity marker of a
society shaped by Christianity. However, the development of a Christian Sunday
culture took several centuries until the early Middle Ages, although already in
321 AD, Constantine had decreed a law to rest on the sacred Sun-Day. One reason
was probably an intentional distancing from both Jewish Sabbath observation and
beliefs in pagan Tagwählerei (unlucky days) and comparable astrological
practices. Later on, when this anti-pagan issue diminished, and when pagan cults
and calendars lost importance, a Sunday observance and veneration emerged as one
element among other aspects of Christianization and sacralization of the
Christian society in Late Antiquity, including holy places and holy people.
Especially the sixth century seemed to be an important "watershed" in this
respect, when new apocryphal literature and pseudepigraphy dealing with the
Sunday was produced. The elevation of Sunday reflected a unification of feasts
that were formerly variously celebrated within different social and religious
groups.

The project aims answering the following questions:

- What was the reason for and the effect of Constantine’s law? What did it mean
  for the Roman calendar in general?
- Did Sunday take over the role of the nundinae?
- What did Christians think of and do on Sunday? What was the reason for the
  hesitant Christian reception?
- What was the influence of Judaism?
- What provoked the appearance of more Sunday laws and increased veneration of
  Sunday since the sixth century?
- Why do we have substantial apocryphal and pseudepigraphic writings on this
  topic?
- Have there been different positions on Sunday veneration in different
  Christian groups?
- Are there differences between the Latin West and Eastern regions?

### Innovation

This estimation above is a first suggestion because the history of Sunday
veneration after Constantine is a completely neglected subject in research. In
addition, former studies rely on now obsolete decline theories of church life
and theology (Legalism, Judaization, Germanization). New insights into the
process of Christianization of the Romans Empire, the relationship between East
and West and the centuries of the Migration Period have to be taken as the basis
for understanding the emergence of Sunday veneration.

### Methods

To broaden the evidence on Sunday veneration, three main strategies are used:
data base research, biblical reference research and manuscript network analysis.
In addition, papyri and inscriptions are relevant as a kind of "social data."
The project relies on the scientific historical-critical analysis of the
sources, based on the new theory of "Intersectionality." Adjacent fields will be
included on the basis of interdisciplinary workshops and presentations.

The aim is to

- develop the new database "Sunday Observance in Late Antiquity"
- edit a volume including the organized papers of the international conferences
  as well as of the workshops
- publish a monograph on The Apocryphal Sunday in Late Antiquity and the Early
  Middle Ages, and
- present a new critical edition of the Didaskalia of Jesus Christ, an important
  apocalyptic-apocryphal text related to Sunday veneration (6th century).
