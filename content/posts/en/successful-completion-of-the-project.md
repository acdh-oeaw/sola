T﻿he project was completed almost in time in January 2024.

6﻿55 passages of 223 works of more than 166 authors have been sampled and evaluated. Of course, there will be passages left, but the aim to to provide access to the vast majority of texts dealing with Sunday from the second quarter of the 4th up to the 7th century was achieved and we are confident that this collection will be a solid base for further investigations about Sunday in Late Antiquity.
