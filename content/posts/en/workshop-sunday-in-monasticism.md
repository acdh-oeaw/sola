On Friday, 11 September 2020, a workshop on "Sunday in Monasticism" took place
in the Faculty of Protestant Theology. In compliance with the coronavirus
measures of the University of Vienna, a small group of experts came together to
discuss preliminary results and open questions on monastic Sunday practice. The
focus was particularly on source texts on Eastern monasticism from the 4th-6th
centuries, although an outlook on Late Antique monasticism in the Latin West was
also given.

In addition to the lively discussion on particular project-relevant text
passages, the guest lectures by Prof. Claudia Rapp (Department for Byzantine and
Modern Greek Studies, University of Vienna) on the topic
"Gottesdienstverweigerung und monastische Hybris in der Spätantike" and Prof.
Andreas Müller (Faculty of Protestant Theology, Christian-Albrecht University of
Kiel) on "Der Sonntag im Palästinischen Mönchtum" were the highlight of the
event.
