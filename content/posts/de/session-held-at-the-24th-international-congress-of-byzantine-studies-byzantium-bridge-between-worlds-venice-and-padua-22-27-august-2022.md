This session focuses on powerful or efficacious periods of time in Byzantine late antiquity. The discussion will include philosophical, theological, eschatological, political, and economic perspectives on time. In this session, the power associated with vigils, days of the week, temporal rhythms, calendrical time, and apocalyptic time will be discussed. What makes a time powerful or suitable for important actions? What types of activities are "time-bound"? What philosophical and eschatological importance was attached to time, and how were those periods of time conceived? These questions will be addressed by an interdisciplinary constellation of scholars and provide a basis for a larger discussion of Byzantine notions of powerful time in late antiquity.
